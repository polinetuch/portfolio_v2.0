          <h3>Why did I switch my career from teaching to coding?</h3>
          <p>
            Back in the days that I was completing my teaching degree in 2014. I
            stumbled upon this curriculum called STEM. I was like "Wow, this is
            new!" and that I never knew there was so much more involved in STEM
            areas rather than just being a scientist. This made me reflect back
            on my high school days, when I learnt the basic of HTML. The
            instructor taught me how to create a h1 tag to say "HELLO WORLD". I
            could not do it. I lost my hope in coding. It was still lingering in
            my mind throughout my bachelor. I remembered my mum said that the
            the STEM work fields are only for males. She was too scared to send
            me to that university. Until I moved to Australia, I saw the many
            great opportunities waiting out there for me. It took several years
            for me to finally make that decision. Being introduced to the Monash
            University Coding Bootcamp was probably the best thing that happened
            in 2019. The struggles of juggling between work and study was so
            much worth it and I loved every moment of it.

          <h3>Becoming a full-stack web developer</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, I have practised and learnt all the fundamental skills to web
            application such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, Axios,
            Node Js, Express Js, Handlebars, React Js, MySQL, Sequelize,
            MongoDB, Mongoose, Postman, Web API and Heroku.

          <h3>Looking for an opportunity!!!</h3>
          <p>
            Like people would always say "Never stop learning". Though I have
            picked up skills from an intensive 6 months of coding program. I
            still want to learn more about the world of computing and
            programming. I am looking for an opportunity to be apart of a
            developer's team, to contribute, to be a team player and to learn.

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          As you know my name is Polinet Uch. Some would call me Poli or even
          Polinet. I was born and raised in Cambodia. I moved to Australia in
          2013, which was a year after I finished high school. I took up a
          teaching certificate to diploma and a degree. There are both pros and
          cons to this field of study even if I knew that I wanted to do coding
          as a career. Being unable to afford a university degree in IT and all
          the criticism that I should not had listened to, I ended up finishing
          the Bachelor of ECT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Till mid 2019, I was introduced to Monash University Coding Bootcamp.
          After working in the teaching industry for two years. I began to
          realize even more that it wasn't where I belong. Being apart of the
          bootcamp helped me understand so much more about technology and the
          skills that you can apply to many other areas in life such as problem
          solving and the ability to challenge yourself to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from attending the bootcamp, I have also had many inspirations
          from the people around me. Majority of them are working in the
          industry and I was able to ask for suggestions and ideas and the
          pathway that I should undertake whilst coming back a non-technical
          neither business background.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've met many fellow developers who are as passionate in coding as I
          am. I should many think this is just a small step to something but I
          consider this as my proudest and biggest achievement. To finally do
          something that I enjoy and from not knowing nothing to learn so much.
